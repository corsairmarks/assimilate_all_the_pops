[h1]Overview[/h1]
Do you want to assimilate all your Pops in all the ways? Then this mod is for you!

Regular empires can select any or all of: Synthetic Evolution, The Flesh is Weak, Mind Over Matter, and Engineered Evolution. Driven Assimilator machine empires can select either or both: Organo-Machine Interfacing and Synthetic Age. Hive-minded empires can select either or both: Organo-Machine Interfacing and Engineered Evolution.

You'll have all the corresponding assimilation types available to your empire, but they must be applied one-at-a-time.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Allows regular empires to select Synthetic Evolution, The Flesh is Weak, Mind Over Matter, and/or Engineered Evolution. Allows Driven Assimilator machine empires to select both Organo-Machine Interfacing and Synthetic Age. Allows hive-minded empires to select both Organo-Machine Interfacing and Engineered Evolution. Also allows selecting the relevant ascension path traditions in combination with one-another.

Disables the "remove psionic" and "remove cybernetic" versions of the assimilation living standards. The game objects still exist, but they are no longer allowed for use (and the game should switch ongoing assimilations to the non-trait-specific version due to weight changes).

Psionic traits are still incompatible with hive minds, as in the unmodded game.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor." Not compatible with achievements.

This mod overrides the seven ascension path-related ascension perks. It is generally not compatible with other mods that alter Synthetic Evolution, Synthetic Age, The Flesh is Weak, Organo-Machine Interfacing (both versions), Mind Over Matter, and Engineered Evolution. However, this mod features native support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960179456]Planetary Diversity - Shroud Worlds[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1740165239]Planetary Diversity - Unique Worlds[/url].

This mod is also not compatible with mods that adjust the Synthetics, Cybernetics, Psionics, or Genetics tradition categories (changes to individual tradition choices are compatible). Note that if you are playing Origin: The Children of Unit 04 from Planetary Diversity - Unique Worlds, be sure to choose the Bio-Synthetics tradition group before selecting any of the assimilation-related tradition groups (you do not need to finish the group, just unlocking it first is sufficient).

Also overridden are some events and other game code related to implementing assimilation:
[list]
[*]Event [b]action.64[/b] - assimilation setup event, altered to ue triggers and effects (which themselves simply the game logic)
[*]Event [b]action.65[/b] - main assimilation event, altered to use less duplicate code and pass two variables to its effect calls - the current number of assimilated Pops and the total number allowed for the year
[*]Event [b]utopia.2551[/b] - Synthetic Evolution, altered to not change synthetic leaders of other species into the empire's main species (cyborgs are still fair game, however) and attempt to create an initial synthetic species with similar traits to the previous, organic species
[*]Effect [b]assimilation_effect[/b] - main assimilation logic (called by [b]action.65[/b]), altered so that deassimilated machines are not converted into the synthetic species for fully synthetic empires, also code de-duped
[*]Citizenship [b]citizenship_assimilation[/b] - Assimilation, improved to understand that empires can have multiple assimilation types available
[/list]
Do you want this mod to be compatible with your favorite "more tradition slots" mod? Simply override the scripted variable [b]assimilate_all_the_pops_tradition_categories_max[/b] and set it equal to the maximum number of tradition slots allowed by your other mod. Ascension perk tradition slot checks (i.e. "Requires an empty Tradition Tree slot.") in this mod will use that number. Support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic[/url] and its Tradition/Ascension Perk slot submods is already built-in. Also supports the tradition variable from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2868680633]Scripted Trigger Undercoat[/url] but does not offer full support for other features of STU.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be added before or during a game. The new rules for allowing multiple "ascension path" ascension perks will take effect immediately, even for empires which have already chosen an ascension path. It is not recommended to remove during a game, as it could cause problems that have selected multiple ascension perks which are incompatible without this mod. Always back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[h3]Not Included in "Subtle Polish"[/h3]
This mod is intentionally not included in my modpack [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] because it contains a significant gameplay change. It is otherwise fully compatible. Also note that Subtle Polish contains both required dependencies - you do not need to subscribe to them separately.
