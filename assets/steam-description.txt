[h1]Overview[/h1]
Do you want to assimilate all your Pops in all the ways? Then this mod is for you!

Regular empires can select any or all of: Synthetic Evolution, The Flesh is Weak, Mind Over Matter, and Engineered Evolution. Driven Assimilator machine empires can select either or both: Organo-Machine Interfacing and Synthetic Age. Hive-minded empires can select either or both: Organo-Machine Interfacing and Engineered Evolution.

You'll have all the corresponding assimilation types available to your empire, but they must be applied one-at-a-time.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Allows regular empires to select Synthetic Evolution, The Flesh is Weak, Mind Over Matter, and/or Engineered Evolution. Allows Driven Assimilator machine empires to select both Organo-Machine Interfacing and Synthetic Age. Allows hive-minded empires to select both Organo-Machine Interfacing and Engineered Evolution. Also allows selecting the relevant ascension path traditions in combination with one-another.

Disables the "remove psionic" and "remove cybernetic" versions of the assimilation living standards. The game objects still exist, but they are no longer allowed for use (and the game should switch ongoing assimilations to the non-trait-specific version due to weight changes).

Psionic traits are still incompatible with hive minds, as in the unmodded game.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
This mod overrides the seven ascension path-related ascension perks. It is not compatible with other mods that alter Synthetic Evolution, Synthetic Age, The Flesh is Weak, Organo-Machine Interfacing (both versions), Mind Over Matter, and Engineered Evolution. It is also not compatible with mods that adjust the Synthetics, Cybernetics, Psionics, or Genetics tradition categories (changes to individual tradition choices are compatible).

Built for Stellaris version 3.6 "Orion." Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Not Included in "Subtle Polish"[/h3]
This mod is intentionally not included in my modpack [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish: A Collection of Fixes and Enhancements[/url] because it contains a significant gameplay change. It is otherwise fully compatible.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be added before or during a game. The new rules for allowing multiple "ascension path" ascension perks will take effect immediately, even for empires which have already chosen an ascension path. It is not recommended to remove during a game, as it could cause problems that have selected multiple ascension perks which are incompatible without this mod. Always back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553812372]Deassimilate Machines[/url] contains all the changes to the Assimilation citizenship type and assimilation process required to support multiple assimilation types in one empire
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2601239912]Psionic Ascension: Even in Other Empires[/url] grants the Latent Psionic and Psionic traits to all members of a species (galaxy-wide) when their founding empire chooses Psionic ascension; works with this mod to allow cybernetic Pops to also gain psionic powers
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295]Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits[/url] ensures that your leaders gain all applicable leader traits for any species traits their species possesses (such as Psionic, Cybernetic, and/or Erudite)
