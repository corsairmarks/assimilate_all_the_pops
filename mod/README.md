### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.

# TODO

Submod:

Override triggers/effects from parent mod as needed (might only be a few effects!)
Override all assimilation living standard to be unlocked and as loosely limited as possible (probably all done in DM)
Add links on All Leader Traits, Psionic Whole Galaxy, Machine Deassim, maybe Keep Leaders
